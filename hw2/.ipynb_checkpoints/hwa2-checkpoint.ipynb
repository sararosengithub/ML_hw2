    "1. Write **efficient vectorized** code whenever possible. Some calculations in this exercise take several minutes when implemented efficiently, and might take much longer otherwise. Unnecessary loops will result in point deduction.\n",
    "1. You are responsible for the correctness of your code and should add as many tests as you see fit. Those tests will not be graded nor checked.\n",
    "1. You are free to add code and markdown cells as you see fit.\n",
    "1. Write your functions in this jupyter notebook only. Do not create external python modules and import from them.\n",
    "1. You are allowed to use functions and methods from the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) and [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/reference/) only, unless otherwise mentioned.\n",
    "1. Your code must run without errors. During the environment setup, you were given a specific version of Python of install (`Python >= 3.6, numpy >= 1.14`). \n",
    "1. Answers to qualitative questions should be written in **markdown cells (with $\\LaTeX$ support)**.\n",
    "1. Submit this jupyter notebook only using your ID as a filename. No not use ZIP or RAR. For example, your submission should look like this: `123456789.ipynb` if you worked by yourself or `123456789_987654321.ipynb` if you worked in pairs.\n",

    "1. Practice OOP in python.\n",
    "2. Implement two impurity measures: Gini and Entropy.\n",
    "3. Construct a decision tree algorithm.\n",
    "4. Prune the tree to achieve better results.\n",

In addition, it might be a good idea to store the **prediction** in that node, the **height** of the tree for that node and whether or not that node is a **leaf** in the tree.\n",

Determine the threshold for splitting by checking all possible features and the values available for splitting. When considering the values, take the average of each consecutive pair. For example, for the values [1,2,3,4,5] you should test possible splits on the values [1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5]. \n",
